#' @description Computes the effective range of a smoothing matrix,
#' which is measure of the distance to which smoothing occurs.
#' This is motivated by the application of spatial splines for adjusting
#' for unmeasured spatial confounding in regression models, but the
#' calculation of effective range can be applied to smoothing
#' matrices in other contexts. For algorithmic details see
