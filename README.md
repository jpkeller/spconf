# spconf

R Package for Spatial Confounding

This package is designed to calculate the *effective bandwidth* of a spatial smoothing matrix, following the procedure described by Keller and Szprio [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11161 or https://doi.org/10.1111/rssa.12556]. The primary function is `compute_effective_range()`.


### Installation
